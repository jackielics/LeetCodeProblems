# Intuition
1-DP
# Approach
record the max and min product meanwhile dynamically, not neccessarily 1-dp array

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$

- Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$

# Code
```
class Solution:
	def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
		'''
		record the max and min product meanwhile dynamically
		'''
		res = float('-inf') # max product
		curMax = curMin = 1 # max/min product in the current string

		for num in nums:
			# right expression will be calculated before left
			products = (curMin * num, curMax * num, num)
			curMax, curMin = max(products), min(products)
			res = max(res, curMax)  # update max product

		return res
```
