# Problem
[177. Nth Highest Salary]

# Key Intuition
1. DECLARE variables before RETURN in function
2. use window function rank()

# Code
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
DECLARE M INT; 
    SET M = N-1; 
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
        select (
            select distinct salary
            from Employee
            order by salary desc
            limit M,1
        ) as getNthHighestSalary
  );
END
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION getNthHighestSalary(N INT) RETURNS INT
BEGIN
  RETURN (
      # Write your MySQL query statement below.
      select t.Salary
      from (select Salary, (rank() over(order by salary desc)) as 'rk'
            from Employee
            group by Salary) as t
      where t.rk = N
  );
END
```
